## 1. Algorithms

An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure.
A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate
access and modifications.

## 2. Algorithms as a technology

Since computers are not infinitely fast,
and memory is not free,
**efficient** algorithms stand out.
A usual measure of efficiency is speed.

Algorithms are important on contemporary computers in light of other advanced
technologies.
